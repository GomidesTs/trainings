Learning concepts like refactoring is a disciplined way to rebuild your code when small changes are made to improve your design.
An important aspect of refactoring is improving the design without changing the behavior of the design. Refactoring does not add or remove features.

Refactoring allows you to slowly evolve your code over time, allowing for an iterative, step-by-step approach to your implementation.
